# Catfish

Catfish (Siluridse) in natural conditions showed signs of restlessness about six hours before earthquake disturbances were registered on their recording apparatus.

As the sensing ability of the fish, we create this App for checking the location with the risk of natural disaster(ex: earthquake), and sincerely hope it can help people to find a safer place to live or making any decision before they starting their new life.

## Development

Run `yarn dev` to develop the app in the localhost.

## Testing

[WIP] planning to add:

1. Jest for the unit test
2. Testing-library for the integration test
3. Cypress for the e2e test

## Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete. To run type checking across the whole project, run `yarn tsc`.

## Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting. That is configured in `.eslintrc.json`.

## Formatting

Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project. Highly recommended to install an editor plugin (like the [VSCode Prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)) to get auto-formatting on save. There's also a `yarn format` script you can run to format all files at the same time.
